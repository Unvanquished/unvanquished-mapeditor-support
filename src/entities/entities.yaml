      [q3map] Used for lights with "style" set. Star is replaced by numbers.
    _ambient: >
      [q3map] Adds a constant value to overall lighting. Use is not recommended.
      Ambient light will have a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.

      [q3map] q3map always splits the BSP tree along the planes.
      Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times
      on very large maps with a low structural brush density.

  color: a6a6ff
  flags:
  - SPAWN_DISABLED: *Spawn_disabled
  props:
    shader: The name of the shader of the light flare.
    angle: *angle
    angles: This reflects which direction the flare points. It is not important unless
      the second component of the radius key is employed.
    radius: >
      The radius key is a vector.

      The first component is the size of the light flare. The radius is calculated
      by taking the distance of the viewer from the light flare and dividing by this
      key, so the larger the key value, the smaller the flare. Values between 2 and
      10 are sensible.

      The second component indicates the angle around the direction the flare points
      for which it is visible. For example a value of 90 means that you can see the
      flare while infront of the entity, but not when behind it. If set to zero the
      light flare will be visible from any angle

      The third component is similar to the first except that it specifies the size
      of the light source rather than the size of the light flare itself. This is
      useful when the higher detail flare fading modes are enabled. If this is set
      to the same value as the first component, fading will commence as soon as the
      edge of the light flare is occluded by some surface between the viewer and the
      flare. If it is set larger the flare will overlap the occluding surface before
      it begins to fade.
    mindist: Minimal distance for flare to appear.
    speed: Fading time, msec. Useful only for cg_lightFlare 2.

    This camera is used to project its view onto a portal surface
    in the level through the intermediary of a gfx_portal_surface entity. Use the
    "angles" key or target a pos_target entity to set the camera's pointing direction.

    Both the setting "angles" key or targeting a pos_target methods can be
    used to aim the camera. However, the pos_target method is simpler. In both
    cases, the "roll" key must be used to set the roll angle.

    By default camera is wiggling. Use spawnflags to make it rotate or stand still.

    Notes).

    The entity must be no farther than 64 units away from the portal surface to lock
    onto it. To make a mirror, apply the common/mirror shader to the surface, place
    this entity near it but don't target a gfx_portal_camera.

    Sound generating entity.

    The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder
    character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For
    example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams
    and dies when he falls into, you would place a sensor_player over the floor
    of the pit and target a spx_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise"
    key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound
    folder. So if your current player model is Granger, * = sound/player/builder, if your
    current player model is Battlesuit Human, * = sound/player/human_bsuit, etc. This cool feature
    provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your
    levels. Implies ACTIVATOR_SPEAKER on.
