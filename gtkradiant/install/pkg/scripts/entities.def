------ FLAGS ------
LINEAR: Use a linear falloff. Default is inverse distance squared (more realistic).

------ DESCRIPTION ------
Solid entity that describes a pendulum back and forth rotation movement. Rotates on the X axis by default. Pendulum frequency is a physical constant based on the length of the beam and gravity. Blocking the pendulum instantly kills a player.
The speed of swing (frequency) is not adjustable.

mindist: Minimal distance for flare to appear. (int, def: 0)
origin: Position. (vec3_float)
radius: The radius key is a vector.
The first component is the size of the light flare. The radius is calculated by taking the distance of the viewer from the light flare and dividing by this key, so the larger the key value, the smaller the flare. Values between 2 and 10 are sensible.
The second component indicates the angle around the direction the flare points for which it is visible. For example a value of 90 means that you can see the flare while infront of the entity, but not when behind it. If set to zero the light flare will be visible from any angle
The third component is similar to the first except that it specifies the size of the light source rather than the size of the light flare itself. This is useful when the higher detail flare fading modes are enabled. If this is set to the same value as the first component, fading will commence as soon as the edge of the light flare is occluded by some surface between the viewer and the flare. If it is set larger the flare will overlap the occluding surface before it begins to fade. (vec3_float)

The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model.

Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Granger, * = sound/player/builder, if your current player model is Battlesuit Human, * = sound/player/human_bsuit, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.
