Unvanquished support for J.A.C.K
================================

Installation
------------

[J.A.C.K](https://jack.hlfx.ru/en) (previously _JackHammer_) does not know what is a gamepack.

You must download the [fgd file](/build/jackhammer/install/unvanquished.fgd) yourself and configure J.A.C.K to use it.

You can follow this [Tremulous tutorial](https://jack.hlfx.ru/en/articles/4/jack_trem.html) and adapt it for Unvanquished.

Do nothing with `.dpk` files as their content is not supported. Copy files from the [UnvanquishedAssets](https://github.com/UnvanquishedAssets/UnvanquishedAssets) repository instead.
